# RelayRunner

RelayRunner is intended to facility testing in controlled environments by adding the capability to update load test configs without restarting load clients.

## Client Application Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm clean-install`: Installs npm dependecies.

- `npm start` : Runs the app in development mode

- `npm run lint` : Runs Linter and automatically fixes Linter recommended changes

- `npm test` : Launches the test runner, jest, in the interactive watch mode.

- `npm run build` : Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

- `npm run eject` : Removes the single build dependency from project and copies all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them.
  - *Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!*

## Running the Client Application Locally

1. Clone the Repo `git clone https://github.com/retaildevcrews/relayrunner.git`
2. Change into the relayrunner directory `cd relayrunner`
3. Start the k3d cluster `make create`
4. Deploy a pod with relayrunner-backend `make rrapi`
5. Change into the client directory `cd client`
6. Install node dependencies `npm clean-install`
7. Start the client `npm start`

## Testing the Client Application

Run tests on Client components and functions using `npm test`

## Serve the Client Application on NGINX

```bash
// Use k3d to create a cluster
make create
// Build the client in production mode and serve on a pod running nginx
make rrui
```
